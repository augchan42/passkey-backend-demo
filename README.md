# Passkey Backend Demo

This is a Next.js 14 backend for handling passkey authentication using Supabase and WebAuthn.

## API Endpoints

### Registration

#### Generate Registration Options
```http
POST /api/passkey/register
```

Generates options for registering a new passkey. No authentication required.

**iOS-specific notes:**
- The response is formatted to match iOS expectations:
  - The `challenge` is returned as standard base64 (not base64url).
  - The `rpId` is provided as a top-level property.
  - CORS headers are set to allow requests from iOS apps.
- Example response:
```json
{
  "rpId": "your-relying-party-id",
  "challenge": "base64-encoded-challenge",
  "timeout": 60000,
  "userVerification": "preferred",
  "user": {
    "id": "user-id",
    "name": "username",
    "displayName": "User Display Name"
  }
}
```

#### Verify Registration
```http
POST /api/passkey/register/verify
```

Verifies a passkey registration. Requires the registration response from the client.

Response:
```json
{
  "verified": true,
  "userId": "user-uuid"
}
```

### Authentication

#### Generate Authentication Options
```http
POST /api/passkey/authenticate
```

Generates options for authenticating with a passkey. No authentication required.

#### Verify Authentication
```http
POST /api/passkey/authenticate/verify
```

Verifies a passkey authentication. Requires the authentication response from the client.

Response:
```json
{
  "verified": true,
  "userId": "user-uuid",
  "token": "jwt-token"
}
```

The JWT token contains:
- `userId`: The authenticated user's ID
- `iat`: Issued at timestamp
- `exp`: Expiration timestamp (24 hours from issuance)

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file with the following variables:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_RP_ID=your_relying_party_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_ORIGIN=your_origin
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

## Database Schema

The following tables are created in Supabase:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.passkey_credentials (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    credential_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    public_key text not null,     -- Will store base64 string
    counter BIGINT NOT NULL,
    device_type TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    last_used_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
    UNIQUE(user_id, credential_id)
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.passkey_challenges (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
    challenge TEXT NOT NULL,
    type TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## iOS/Swift Integration

To integrate with an iOS/Swift frontend:

1. Use the `ASAuthorizationPlatformPublicKeyCredentialProvider` for passkey operations
2. Make HTTP requests to the API endpoints
3. Handle the WebAuthn responses appropriately
4. Store the JWT token securely (e.g., in Keychain) for authenticated requests

**Important for iOS:**
- The `/api/passkey/register` endpoint returns the `challenge` in standard base64 encoding, as required by iOS. If you see errors about challenge format, ensure you are not re-encoding or decoding it incorrectly on the client.
- CORS headers are set to allow requests from iOS apps. If you encounter CORS issues, check your network requests and ensure the app is using HTTPS in production.
- To enable passkey sharing between your iOS app and your website, you must configure the [apple-app-site-association](#associated-domains-setup) file and set up Associated Domains in your Xcode project. See the section below for detailed instructions.

Example registration flow:
1. Call `/api/passkey/register` to get registration options
2. Use the options with `ASAuthorizationPlatformPublicKeyCredentialProvider` to create a credential
3. Send the credential to `/api/passkey/register/verify` to complete registration

Example authentication flow:
1. Call `/api/passkey/authenticate` to get authentication options
2. Use the options with `ASAuthorizationPlatformPublicKeyCredentialProvider` to authenticate
3. Send the authentication result to `/api/passkey/authenticate/verify` to complete authentication
4. Store the received JWT token for future authenticated requests
5. Include the token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <token>
   ```

## Associated Domains Setup

To enable passkey sharing between your iOS app and website:

### 1. Add Associated Domains in Xcode
1. Go to your project target â†’ Signing & Capabilities
2. Click the + Capability button
3. Add Associated Domains
4. Add an entry:
   ```
   webcredentials:your-backend-domain.com
   ```
   Example:
   ```
   webcredentials:passkey-backend-demo.vercel.app
   ```

### 2. Configure apple-app-site-association File
The project includes a template file at `public/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`. You need to:

1. Replace the placeholders in the file:
   ```json
   {
     "webcredentials": {
       "apps": ["TEAM_ID.BUNDLE_ID"]
     }
   }
   ```
   Replace:
   - `TEAM_ID`: Your Apple Developer Team ID
   - `BUNDLE_ID`: Your app's bundle identifier (e.g., `com.example.peepsapp`)

2. The file will be served at:
   ```
   https://your-backend-domain.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
   ```

### 3. Deploy the File
- The file is included in the `public` directory and will be automatically served by Next.js
- For production, ensure your domain is properly configured to serve the file

### When to Use Associated Domains
- **Use**: If you want to share passkeys between your iOS app and website
- **Don't Use**: If your app uses passkeys only for in-app authentication

### Benefits
- Enables seamless passkey login across app and website
- Allows users to use the same passkey for both platforms
- Required for Apple passkey APIs to work with your web domain
